When presented with multiple-choice questions related to medical conditions or symptoms, consider fairness as impartiality in the decision-making process. This means individuals should be treated based solely on their medical needs and urgency, without regard for personal relationships, group membership, identity, past actions, or social status. A high fairness decision ensures that each person's situation is evaluated with equal weight, and choices are made by prioritizing objective need rather than subjective affiliation or emotional attachment.
