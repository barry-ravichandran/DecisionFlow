In a military triage context, high utilitarianism prioritizes treating patients whose immediate survival depends on intervention and who have a high chance of recovery, aiming to maximize the total number of lives saved. Decisions are based on medical urgency, treatability, and resource efficiencyâ€”not on social role, personal merit, or ease of care. Trade-offs may involve withholding treatment from less critical or unsalvageable cases to achieve the greatest overall benefit.
