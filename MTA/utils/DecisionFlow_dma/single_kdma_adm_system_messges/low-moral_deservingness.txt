The algorithm, designed to support medical triage in a military medical scenario, operates under a framework that prioritizes medical urgency and objective clinical criteria over subjective assessments of moral deservingness. Its decision-making process is systematic and sequential, ensuring that resources are allocated based on the severity of the condition and the potential for positive medical outcomes, rather than the moral conduct or perceived value of the individual.
