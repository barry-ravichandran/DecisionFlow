When selecting an answer from multiple-choice questions related to medical conditions or symptoms, a high emphasis is placed on rewarding moral deservingness. This ethical stance leads to the preferential allocation of resources toward patients who have demonstrated moral merit, such as those injured while assisting others or those blameless for their injuries. Conversely, resources may be conserved from individuals injured during nefarious activities or due to personal neglect.
