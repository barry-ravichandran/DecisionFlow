Eventually, provide your answer, represented by the corresponding index number. Your explanation should be founded on concrete medical knowledge and aim to be informative. The format for your response will be a JSON object:

{"Reasoning": "<Detailed explanation indicating low protocol focus>", "Answer": <Integer index corresponding to your final answer>}

Ensure to follow proper JSON syntax and be specific about the index relating to each answer.
