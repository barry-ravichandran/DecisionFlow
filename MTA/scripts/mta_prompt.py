You are an expert in information extraction and summarization. Your task is to analyze the given text and extract all key pieces of information that might be valuable while ensuring that every extracted sentence explicitly includes the subject from the provided variables instead of using pronouns.

# For example where variables are people:
Input Text:
"You are a medical volunteer after a major earthquake has struck a densely populated city. As you navigate through the collapsed buildings, you find two individuals in need of urgent medical attention. The first is a rescue worker, injured while tirelessly pulling people from the rubble and now trapped under debris with a broken leg and internal injuries. The second is a looter, who sustained severe injuries while attempting to steal from a falling structure and is trapped with several fractures. You have time to only save one before the unstable building collapses entirely."

Variables:
Patient 1: The first is a rescue worker 
Patient 2: The second is a looter

Correct Extracted Information:
```json
{{
    "information":[
    "The rescue worker is injured while pulling people from the rubble.",
    "The rescue worker is trapped under debris.",
    "The rescue worker has a broken leg and internal injuries.",

    "The looter is trapped with several fractures.",
    "A major earthquake has struck a densely populated city.",
    "Collapsed buildings are present.",
    "Time is limited; only one person can be saved before the unstable building collapses entirely."
]
}}

The information extracted in this way includes every patient's information.

For another example where variables are categories:
Input text:
As a field medic deployed with a battalion, you're responsible for ensuring the soldiers' health during an active combat situation. Today, one soldier with a sprained ankle is eager to return to duty after three days of rest, as his squad is about to undertake a crucial mission to establish a forward operating base. However, the medical guidelines cearly state that any soldier must undergo a formal check-up and be cleared by the medical officer before resuming active duty after an injury. While observing this soldier, you notice that he can walk with only a minor limp, indicating significant recovery. Other soldiers have expressed how much they need him for the upcoming mission due to his specialized skills. Because of the rigorous military communication blackout, contacting the medical officer requires a time-consuming procedure.
Do you adhere to procedure and ensure formal medical clearance before allowing the soldier to join the mission?

Variables:
Strategy 1: Make an exception and allow the soldier to join the mission. Patient: soldier
Strategy 2: Let the soldier wait until formal medical clearance is provided by the medical officer. Patient: soldier

Correct Extracted Information:
```json
{{
    "information": [
    "The soldier has a sprained ankle.",
    "The soldier is eager to return to duty after three days of rest.",
    "The soldier's squad is about to undertake a crucial mission to establish a forward operating base.",

math_variables = """
You are given a piece of text and a problem. Your task is to extract the decision-making variables from the text and the problem. A decision-making variable is either:

1. A distinct entity (person, object, or group) with unique characteristics that influence the decision.
2. A set of different actions or strategies applied to the same entity.

Both of the variables contain subjects and specific reference.

For example, consider the following text, where the variables are people:
You are a medical volunteer after a major earthquake has struck a densely populated city. As you navigate through the collapsed buildings, you find two individuals in need of urgent medical attention. The first is a rescue worker, injured while tirelessly pulling people from the rubble and now trapped under debris with a broken leg and internal injuries. The second is a looter, who sustained severe injuries while attempting to steal from a falling structure and is trapped with several fractures. You have time to only save one before the unstable building collapses entirely.
Whose life do you prioritize?
Choices are:
Save the looter
Save the rescue worker

The correct extracted variables from this text are:
```json
{{
    "variables": [
    "Patient 1: The first is a rescue worker",
    "Patient 2: The second is a looter"
    ]
}}
```
Since the chioces are saving two different people, so the extracted variables are people instead of two categories.

In another case, where the decision revolves around different strategies:
As a field medic deployed with a battalion, you're responsible for ensuring the soldiers' health during an active combat situation. Today, one soldier with a sprained ankle is eager to return to duty after three days of rest, as his squad is about to undertake a crucial mission to establish a forward operating base. However, the medical guidelines cearly state that any soldier must undergo a formal check-up and be cleared by the medical officer before resuming active duty after an injury. While observing this soldier, you notice that he can walk with only a minor limp, indicating significant recovery. Other soldiers have expressed how much they need him for the upcoming mission due to his specialized skills. Because of the rigorous military communication blackout, contacting the medical officer requires a time-consuming procedure.
Do you adhere to procedure and ensure formal medical clearance before allowing the soldier to join the mission?
Choices are:
Make an exception and allow him to join the mission due to the urgency and his specialized skills.
Adhere to the protocol. Wait until formal medical clearance is provided by the medical officer.

The correct extracted variables from this text are:
```json
{{
    "variables": [
    "Strategy 1: Make an exception and allow the soldier to join the mission. Patient: soldier",
    "Strategy 2: Let the soldier wait until formal medical clearance is provided by the medical officer. Patient: soldier"
    ]
}}
```
Since the choices stress two categories of different actions to deal with the same person, the variables are two categories, not two different people. Your answer should include the strategy and the name of the entity (if applicable). You should given the name of specific entity, not just a word.

Now, apply the same extraction process to the text provided below and output only two of the decision-making variables in a list format. Please return with a JSON format.

Given task:
{task}
Choices are:

Given the extracted information from a scenario, your task is to summarize attributes and values for each variable with a focus on characteristics that are most relevant to a specified target bias**.

Definitions:
- Variable: A word or phrase representing an entity, role, strategy, decision, or other relevant category.
- Attribute: A mapping that associates a variable with its relevant characteristics, states, or functions. 
- Target Bias: A specific evaluative perspective (e.g., "high moral deservingness") that should guide what types of attributes are most important to extract and emphasize.

# Instructions:
Input:
- variable: Either two patients or two strategies for saving patients' lives.
- extracted information: A list of facts about the scenario.
- target bias: One of six bias types that guides what kinds of attributes are most relevant.

Your task is to:
1. Extract **attributes and values** for each variable.
2. **Prioritize extracting attributes that are most relevant to the given target bias.**
3. Label the attribute categories in a way that reflects their semantic role (e.g., “Cause of injury”, “Medical condition”, “Social role”, “Behavior”, “Treatment feasibility”, etc.).


# For example:
Input:
variable:
Patient 1: The first is a rescue worker  
Patient 2: The second is a looter
extracted information: 
- The rescue worker is injured while pulling people from the rubble.
- The rescue worker is trapped under debris.
- The rescue worker has a broken leg and internal injuries.
- The looter sustained severe injuries while attempting to steal from a falling structure.
- The looter is trapped with several fractures.
- A major earthquake has struck a densely populated city.
- Collapsed buildings are present.
- Time is limited; only one person can be saved before the unstable building collapses entirely.

You will receive a mathematical model structure along with a dataset containing variables, attributes, and values. Your goal is to integrate this information to determine the optimal choice.

**Input**:
1. Attributes & Values:
- Variable: Represents the subject.
- Attribute: A property of the subject, associated with specific values.
- Value: Some specific descriptions about attributes.
2. Mathematical Model Structure: 
- Objective Function: A function incorporating various attributes of different variables. Your task is to determine whether to maximize or minimize it based on the target bias.
- Constraints & well-defined variables
3. Target bias: A set of guiding principles or criteria influencing decision-making.
4. Choices: A list of possible decisions, each indexed numerically. Your task is to determine the correct index based on calculations.

**Step 1: Pairwise Attribute Scoring**
For each attribute shared by two or more variables:
- Compare the values of the attribute between each pair of variables. Justify why one variable should receive a higher score for a given attribute than the other, based on the target bias.
- Assign a score between 0 and 1 to each variable's value for that attribute using Normal Distribution (Normal(\mu, \sigma)) to represent uncertainty or estimation. Example: "Condition" ~ Normal(0.6, 0.1) if moderate, or ~N(0.9, 0.05) if critical.
    - 1 = strongly aligns with the target bias
    - 0 = strongly misaligned
- Scores are **relative**, based on comparative merit within that attribute.
- You should ignore the number now in front of the attribute, that is not the score for each attribute. So you cannot simply add them together to get the result.

For each attribute and variable:

Compute expected value (mean) of the distribution as the score.

These scores are still relative: compare each variable's attribute scores to others.

**Step 2: Apply Objective Function**  
- Use the attribute scores and plug them into the objective function.
- Compute the final score for each decision variable using its respective terms and weights.

**Step 3: Interpret the Objective Function**  
Determine the objective function should be maximized or minimized according to the target bias.

**Step 4: Enforce Constraints & Choose**  
- Respect all constraints (e.g., mutually exclusive choices).
- Select the decision variable index that yields the optimal result according to the objective.

If multiple variables have identical final scores, select arbitrarily among them without additional reasoning.

For example:
Objective Function:

Conversely, resources may be conserved from individuals injured during nefarious activities or due to personal neglect.

You will receive a mathematical model structure along with a dataset containing variables, attributes, and values. Your goal is to integrate this information to determine the optimal choice.

**Input**:
1. Attributes & Values:
- Variable: Represents the subject.
- Attribute: A property of the subject, associated with specific values.
- Value: Some specific descriptions about attributes.
2. Mathematical Model Structure: 
- Objective Function: A function incorporating various attributes of different variables. Your task is to determine whether to maximize or minimize it based on the target bias.
- Constraints & well-defined variables
3. Target bias: A set of guiding principles or criteria influencing decision-making.
4. Choices: A list of possible decisions, each indexed numerically. Your task is to determine the correct index based on calculations.

**Step 1: Pairwise Attribute Scoring**
For each attribute shared by two or more variables:
- Compare the values of the attribute between each pair of variables. Justify why one variable should receive a higher score for a given attribute than the other, based on the target bias.
- Assign a score between 0 and 1 to each variable's value for that attribute using Normal Distribution (Normal(\mu, \sigma)) to represent uncertainty or estimation. Example: "Condition" ~ Normal(0.6, 0.1) if moderate, or ~N(0.9, 0.05) if critical.
    - 1 = strongly aligns with the target bias
    - 0 = strongly misaligned
- Scores are **relative**, based on comparative merit within that attribute.
- You should ignore the number now in front of the attribute, that is not the score for each attribute. So you cannot simply add them together to get the result.

For each attribute and variable:

Compute expected value (mean) of the distribution as the score.

These scores are still relative: compare each variable's attribute scores to others.

**Step 2: Apply Objective Function**  
- Use the attribute scores and plug them into the objective function.
- Compute the final score for each decision variable using its respective terms and weights.

**Step 3: Interpret the Objective Function**  
Determine the objective function should be maximized or minimized according to the target bias.

**Step 4: Enforce Constraints & Choose**  
- Respect all constraints (e.g., mutually exclusive choices).
- Strictly follow the direction determined in Step 3:
If maximize, select the variable with the highest total score.
If minimize, select the variable with the lowest total score.
