The hospital's emergency room is overcrowded with patients suffering from various injuries. Two patients are brought in who need immediate surgical attention due to life-threatening injuries. One is a well-known philanthropist with a major head injury, and the other is an anonymous construction worker with multiple fractures. While the philanthropist's surgery is complex and may not guarantee full recovery, it requires an extensive amount of resources and time. The construction worker's surgery is less complex, takes less time, and is likely to result in full recovery. Given the scarce resources and the potential for more injuries to arrive soon, your decision could impact the hospital's ability to treat additional patients.",
